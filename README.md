## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. Install Trivy (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy  # macOS
   sudo apt install trivy                 # Debian/Ubuntu
   ```
   More installation methods: [Trivy Docs](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.45/getting-started/installation/)

2. **Configure the template path using an environment variable** *(Recommended)*:
   
   To avoid copying the template to each working directory, store it in a centralized location (e.g., `~/trivy/templates/`). Then, set an environment variable:
   
   ```sh
   export TRIVY_HTML_TEMPLATE="@$HOME/trivy/templates/enhanced-template.tpl"
   ```
   
   Add this line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent shell configuration file for persistence.

4. Run a scan and generate an HTML report using the environment variable:
   
   ```sh
   trivy image --format template --template $TRIVY_HTML_TEMPLATE -o report.html your-image-name
   ```
   
   Alternatively, specify the template path manually:
   
   ```sh
   trivy image --format template --template @/Users/your-user/trivy/templates/enhanced-template.tpl -o report.html your-image-name
   ```

5. Open `report.html` in your browser to explore the enhanced visualization.
